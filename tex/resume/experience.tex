    \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item { Developed a Python package and CLI to orchestrate and monitor jobs across AKS and on-prem HPC clusters. Worked directly with research teams on UAT and adoption. }
      \item { Standardized Kubernetes deployments in CI/CD pipeline templates using Helm. Developed Helm charts for realtime- and batch-deployments of machine learning models, and remote development environments. }
      \item { Developed and deployed RESTful API's with FastAPI and Uvicorn to provide a uniform API for Slurm jobs and Argo Workflows. Containerized application with Docker using BuildKit and multistaging. Deployed to an on-prem Kubernetes cluster with Helm and CI/CD pipeline. }
      \item { Created python libraries to reduce code duplication and improve reuse across platform products. Centralized custom types and datamodels with Pydantic. Developed utility packages to standardize logging, parsing of logs, and interactions with Docker images. }
      \item { Spearheaded documentation standards by defining minimum requirements for products lines and products. Used a mixture of Sphinx, Github Pages and Confluence for delivery. }
