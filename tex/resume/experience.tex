    \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item {Wrote and execute plan for deploying a bidding service responsible for supplying bids and other machine learning output for all auction participants. The service is written in Go and uses GRPC. Deployed to EKS in 4 regions using Helm, Argo Rollouts, and Terraform for cloud infrastructure. }
      \item {Designed and implemented runtime configuration stucture for our ML pipelines using Pydantic. Config supports data sampling, feature store integration, and TFX transform configuration, and deployment information. }

  {
    \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item {Refactored several machine learning pipelines responsible for pacing advertiser spend over a given period. Adopted a mini-batch approach. This allowed us onboard ~200 campaigns, roughly 50\% of campaigns at the time, in two months. }
      \item {Performed migration of about 20 machine learning workloads to a new cluster as part of Kubernetes and Kubeflow upgrades. Also moved several pipelines away from using AWS redshift to PySpark. }
      \item {Reduced compute, storage, and observability costs of multiple machine learning workloads by more than \$150K per year. Optimized Spark queries with filters, persistence, and checkpointing. Improved cluster bin-packing by adjusting resource requests, limits and implement mini-batching in workloads. Suppressed C library output to stdout caused by the Python package Prophet in order to reduce log ingestion and indexing costs. }

  {
    \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item { Created Python libraries to reduce code duplication and improve reuse across platform components. Centralized custom types and datamodels with Pydantic. Developed a Python package and CLI to orchestrate and monitor jobs across AKS and on-prem HPC clusters. Worked directly with research teams on UAT and adoption. }
      \item { Standardized Kubernetes deployments in CI/CD pipeline templates using Helm. Developed Helm charts for realtime and batch-deployments of machine learning models, and remote development environments. }
      \item { Developed and deployed REST API's with FastAPI to provide a uniform API for Slurm jobs and Argo Workflows. Deployed to an on-prem Kubernetes cluster using Docker, Helm, and Azure Pipelines. }
